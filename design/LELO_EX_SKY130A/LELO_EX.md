## Damn, that actually worked.

I think I:
- made a basic schematic for a current mirror with a 4:1 ratio (20u out, 5u in) in xschem
- then made a very VERY basic layout based on the pictures in the tutorial (god damn, if we're using magic in further labs, which i assume we are, i feel like i need several days of practice)
